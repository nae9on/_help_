    "2. Every module spans a scope. Ex for numpy module, `dir(np)` can be used to list all the names in the scope.\n",
    "3. Every module/scope has an attribute `__name__` which can be used to query its name. Ex `np.__name__` is \"numpy\".\n",

    "1. \"local\" - innermost scope that’s local to a function. If you refer to x inside a function, then the interpreter first searches for it in this scope.\n",
    "2. \"nonlocal\" - enclosing function’s scope. If x isn’t in the local scope then the interpreter looks in the nonlocal scope.\n",
    "3. \"global\" - outermost scope with `__name__` = \"__main__\". If neither of the above searches is fruitful, then the interpreter looks in the global scope next. The global namespace is created when python environment is first entered, and is never deleted.\n",
    "4. \"\\__builtins\\__\" - contains built-in names (ex `abs()` etc). If it can’t find x anywhere else, then the interpreter tries this scope. It is created when the Python interpreter starts up, and is never deleted.\n",
