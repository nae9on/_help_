 * A std::set is a sorted associative container that contains unique keys. It is similar
 * to std::map and is usually implemented using BST's. However, there are two main
 * differences:
 * 1. Unlike std::map, there is no value associated to the unique key.
 * 2. The value of the elements in a set cannot be modified once in the container
 *    (the elements are always const), but they can be inserted or removed from the
 *    container.
