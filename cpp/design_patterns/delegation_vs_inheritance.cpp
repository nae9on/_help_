/*
 * What is delegation?
 *
 * The delegation pattern allows composition of two objects to achieve similar
 * code reuse capabilities as inheritance. The two objects are referred to as
 * receiving object and delegate object respectively.
 *
 * The receiving object receives the original request which it delegates to the
 * delegate object (also called handler) and in doing so is reusing the handlers
 * code. This is similar to a derived class referring to it's base class in
 * inheritance except in delegation there is no polymorphic relationship between
 * the classes.
 *
 * From the Introduction to Gamma et al. 1994
 * Delegation is a way to make composition as powerful for reuse as inheritance.
 * In delegation, two objects are involved in handling a request: a receiving object
 * delegates operations to its delegate. This is analogous to subclasses deferring
 * requests to parent classes. But with inheritance, an inherited operation can always
 * refer to the receiving object through the this member variable in C++. To achieve
 * the same effect with delegation, the receiver passes itself to the delegate to let
 * the delegated operation refer to the receiver.
 *
 * Advantages over inheritance:
 * 1. It does not force the receiver to except all the methods of the base class
 * for instance addPrinter/removePrinter method is not needed in receiver class.
 * 2. When the base class is final and cannot be extended, inheritance is not
 * an option.
 *
 * Disadvantages:
 * 1. Unlike inheritance, delegation doesnâ€™t facilitate dynamic polymorphism.
 * 2. Receiver class (ie. adobe_pdf_print) cannot be passed to an existing API
 * expecting a delegate class (i.e. printer).
