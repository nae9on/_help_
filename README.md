This repository consists of wiki pages on various topics such as Git; CMake; Compilation and Linking of C++ programs; setting up development environment on Windows, Ubuntu, CentOS; Shell scripting; OpenCV; Eclipse; Virtual Machine etc.

The example codes in C++ and Python aim to explain some of the most important features of these programming languages.

I often update this repository when I learn something new and/or to improve/correct what already exists. All the available information is accompanied by references to their source.
