 * A container adapter is a wrapper around an underlying container providing only a restricted
 * access to the underlying container's functionality.
 *
 * For example std::stack is a container adapter. The underlying container can be std::vector,
 * std::list or std::deque. Reference: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/stack
