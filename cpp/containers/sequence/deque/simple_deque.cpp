 * A deque (pronounced as "deck") stands for doubly ended queue.
 * A deque is very similar to a vector in its use. They provide a similar
 * interface but a very different implementation.
 *
 * The main similarities between vector and deque are:
 * 1. They are both sequence containers.
 * 2. They are both dynamically allocated.
 * 3. They both provide random access iterators.
 *
 * The main differences between vector and deque are:
 * 1. Unlike vector, deque provides efficient insertion and deletion of elements also
 *    the beginning of the sequence, and not only at its end.
 * 2. Unlike vectors, deques are not guaranteed to store all its elements in contiguous
 *    storage locations:
